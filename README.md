1. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List

Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appear only once.

2. Search Insert Position

Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
You may assume no duplicates in the array.

3. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

4. Pascal's Triangle

Given a non-negative integer numRows, generate the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

5. Path Sum

Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.
Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

6. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
